        "Developed a custom software to provide a handheld UHF RFID reader with a REST API interface using a Java-based Software Development Kit (SDK).",
        "Used containerisation (Docker) and open-source less-code tools (i.e. NodeRED) to implement a number of customisable workflows for registering and tracking construction materials on the construction site."
